                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>There is nothing more frustrating than writing your first
                        bit of JavaScript, loading it into the browser, and having
                        NOTHING happen!  No errors on the screen.  No popups saying
                        what is wrong.  It just doesn't work &mdash; but why?</p>
                    <h3>What Went Wrong?</h3>
                    <p>Do you have a syntax error in you code?  Did your code even
                        get loaded onto the page?  Did you mispell a variable name?</p>
                    <p>Without some kind of feedback from the browser (the runtime
                        environment), you can't say for sure.  Sure you can go into
                        your code and look at it line by line and hope that you
                        recognize the error, but wouldn't it be nice if the browser
                        told you what went wrong and even told you what line of your
                        code caused the problem?</p>
                    <p>Luckily, all modern browsers come with development tools either
                        built in or easily added via an extension.  These tools include
                        a JavaScript console, which will print out any errors encountered
                        in parsing or executing your script, as well as the line number
                        that produced the error.  Most will also write the line-number 
                        as a link, so that you can jump right to the error-generating
                        code.</p>
                    <h3>Other Uses for the Console</h3>
                    <p>Getting errors from the console is great, but it can do 
                        much more.  You can also write and paste in small blocks
                        of code for testing purposes.  Think of it like a text
                        editor that will parse and execute your code as you type.
                        This can be helpful for quickly testing your syntax (paste
                        in your code and it will let you know right away if you
                        have a syntax error.)  Later in the course, you might
                        also find this very helpful for testing a jQuery selector.</p>

                    <h2>Usage</h2>
                    <p>The specifics of using each set of developer tools cannot
                        be covered in depth here (refer to the resources section).  
                        However, most will follow a common pattern:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Install or activate the developer tools.</li>
                        <li>Load the developer tools for your page.</li>
                        <li>Activate the console if not already active.</li>
                        <li>Find any error output.</li>
                        <li>Click on the line number to view your code in the
                            browser or go to that line in your text editor.</li>
                        <li>Fix the error and reload.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>What Are All These Other Tabs?</h3>
                    <p>Most developer tools come with much more than a JavaScript
                        console and will include information about the DOM, CSS
                        styles, network requests made by the browser, etc.  All
                        of these are very valuable to you as a web developer but
                        will not be covered in this course.</p>
                    <p>Many of the tools will also include a true <strong>JavaScript
                        debugger</strong> which allows you to set breakpoints, watch
                        expressions, and many of the other debugging features you might
                        be familiar with from another programming language.  These
                        are very powerful tools and indispensable for dealing with
                        complex applications.  If you are already familiar with
                        debugging, you are encouraged to begin to use these tools
                        as well.  If, however, you have no idea what a breakpoint
                        is, don't worry about these extra tabs, and get to know
                        the console.</p>
