                    <blockquote>
                        JSLint is a code quality tool for JavaScript. It takes 
                        a source text and scans it. If it finds a problem, 
                        it returns a message describing the problem and an 
                        approximate location within the source. The problem 
                        is not necessarily a syntax error, although it often 
                        is. JSLint looks at some style conventions as well 
                        as structural problems. It does not prove that your 
                        program is correct. It just provides another set of 
                        eyes to help spot problems.
                        <small>Douglas Crockford, <em>JavaScript: The Good 
                            Parts</em></small>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>JavaScript is very forgiving in its syntax and coding
                        style.  Which makes it very easy to write a piece of 
                        code that is syntactically correct and that executes 
                        without errors, but that is written in a style that 
                        will produce problems during the code's lifetime.</p>
                    <p>Poorly styled code is harder to maintain (both for the 
                        original developer and any future developers), more
                        likely to run into problems with other scripts, and more
                        prone to difficult to debug errors.</p>
                    <h3>Can't I Have My Own Style?</h3>
                    <p>While it is true that all programmers develop their own
                        idiosyncracies and style conventions as they mature, most
                        must also conform to conventions set by their employer,
                        organization, or other community group.</p>
                    <p>As you mature as a JavaScript programmer you will begin
                        to develop opinions about these conventions and know their
                        purpose and value &mdash; and also when the conventions
                        can be broken.</p>

                        <h3>Where Can I Use JSLint?</h3>
                        <p>JSLint can be used in a variety of places:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>JSLint.com</strong> &mdash; The definitive
                                source for JSLint feedback.  Paste in a block of
                                code and get immediate feedback.
                                Oftentimes the error messages returned by jslint.com
                                are difficult to decipher (think the W3C HTML 
                                validator), particularly if you are not familiar 
                                with the rule it is trying to enforce.</li>
                            <li><strong>JSFiddle.net</strong> &mdash; Any fiddle
                                can be "linted" by using the JSLint button.
                                It performs a smaller subset of checks than jslint.com;
                                however, its feedback is generally much easier
                                to understand.</li>
                            <li><strong>Code Editors</strong> &mdash; Many code
                                editors come equipped with some subset of JSLint's
                                tests.  <a href=http://www.aptana.com>Aptana
                                Studio</a> is one example.</li>
