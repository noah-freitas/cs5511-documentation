  <h4>This Project is due October 5, 2012 at midnight.</h4>
  <p>In this project we are going to build a very simple yet functional Slideshow and learn about Javascript Object Oriented programming as we go. </p>
  <p>A primary design goal is to implement the slideshow functionality modularly, so that the code that the user (webpage designer) uses is distinct and separate from the Javascript code that the programmer wrote to implement the slideshow.  </p>
  <p>As in previous projects, we will explore a new HTML5 feature, in this case we will utilize CSS3 animations to create a fadein effect of our slideshow.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What you will learn in this project</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Writing modular Javascript programs</li>
  <li>Writing legible Javascript code</li>
  <li>Object Oriented Programming in Javascript</li>
</ul>

<p>1. The first step of course is to start with an HTML5 document.  In the body of the document, we'll create an element with an ID of slideshow, this element is our container, it will contain the elements that the  slideshow Javascript will render. </p>


</div>
<div class="span8">
  <code>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=en&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=UTF-8&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;SlideShow&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id=slideshow&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</code>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="span4">
<p>2. The design of this slideshow uses a Fade In animation feature implemented using<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css3/css3_animations.asp"> CSS3 @keyframe rules bound to a selector using the animation attribute</a> . These CSS rules are 'internal' to the slideshow &mdash; they should be placed in a file called slideshow.css &mdash; they apply to child nodes that are added (rendered) into the element that we designate as the slideshow container. </p>
<div class="well">
<h4>Coding Standards and Validation</h4>
<p>Beginning with this project, your grade will be based on part on whether your code validates with the JSLint validator.   You can <a href="../../tools/validators.html">learn more about JSLint and coding standards here</a>.</p>
<p>Coding standards enable cleaner and more legible code, both for yourself and for others that may need to understand the code that you have written (such as your instructors.)    If you  code in  HTML and CSS, you are probably familiar with the code validation tools available at www.wc3.org.    If you work with a computer programming language such as Java or C++ your compiler probably enforces many coding conventions.</p>
<p>In Javascript, without a compiler and with our code so visible and continuously changing, it is even more important that we take the steps to ensure our code is legible and that our syntax and naming styles are consistent and free from bug-creating patterns.</p>

3. Now we will start creating the Javascript code for the slideshow.  First we'll create a new file named slideshow.js. </p>
<p>In this project we are going to write the slideshow as a modular object so that it creates it's own namespace under Window, constructs itself and holds all of its information and methods internally. This will ensure that our slideshow program and its members do not conflict with other variables on the page.  In fact, our SlideShow( ) object can be instantiated multiple times on a page without conflicting with itself.</p>
<p>We will use this code pattern to create our SlideShow object. .   It isn't critical that you know exactly what this code means, but in case you are interested, here is what we are doing. First, we define and invoke an anonymous function, passing it a reference to Window (the global scope.)   Internal to the function, we then assign it's constructor function (we'll create the function in the next step) to a new property of Window with the name SlideShow. This will ensure that any call to SlideShow( ) on the page will invoke our object constructor function.  </p>
</div>
<div class="span8">
<code>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
(function (global) {
    'use strict';
    // SlideShow global namespace
     ...
        global.SlideShow = SlideShow;
}(window || this));
</pre>
</code>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="span4">
<p>
4. All of our code for the slideshow will now be properties of this function we've created.   The first property we'll create is the CONSTRUCTOR &mdash; a function named with a Capital by convention, that runs automatically when invoked with the NEW keyword.  In our slideshow example, we are going to pass one argument to the constructor - a string containing the id attribute value of the element to contain the slideshow.</p>
<p>We next declare a few variables within this constructor function.   Note how these variables are declared as properties of an object called 'this'.</p>
<p>In Javascript, 'this' is a very important special keyword. When a function is called as a method, such as object.method( ), 'this' is a variable name that can be used within the method to refer to the object of which the method is a member.</p>
<p><a href="http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/">There is a bit more to THIS</a> than just that explanation, but that will suffice for this project.</p>
</div>
<div class="span8">
<code>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
 var SlideShow = function (domId) {
        this.container = document.getElementById(domId);
        this.pictures = [];
        this.currentPicture = 0;
        this.timer = null;
    };
</pre>
</code>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="span4">
<p>
5.Javascript has the ability to create and manage exceptions, which gives programmers a  tool to anticipate potential situations and deal with them more gracefully than running into a Javascript error.</p>
<p>In this project, we'll place a conditional statement to check that the ID actually references an existing element.  If not,<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_throw.asp"> the Javascript throw statement </a>will create an exception object which contains two properties: name and message. </p>
</div>
<div class="span8">
<code>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
...
        if (this.container === null) {
            throw {
                name: 'BadID',
                message: 'An element with the ID of "' + domId
                    + '" does not exist'
            };
        }
...</pre>
</code>
</div>
</div>



<div class="row">
<div class="span4">
<p>
7. Our SlideShow( ) object now exists, but does nothing. It will  be implemented as a series of methods that are defined within our wrapper function.</p>
<p>The first method we'll create is the RENDER method, which creates the page elements that encompass the slideshow.  We'll define this function as a property of the prototype property of SlideShow. In this way, multiple slideshows (instances of the SlideShow object created with the NEW constructor method invocation) will share the functional code and save memory resources. </p>
<p>The logic of the renderer is pretty straightforward, it builds a string which will be passed the innerHTML property of the element that was passed in as the argument to the constructor method of SlideShow( ). </p>
<p>Notice how we refer to our object properties within this method of the object's prototype, using the THIS keyword. We refer to a few elements of THIS, including references to the picture and a picture counter. The property this.pictures, which we declared as an array in our constructor, appears to refer to an object with two properties: src and caption.  </p>
</div>
<div class="span8">
<code>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
SlideShow.prototype.render = function () {
        var html = '',
            currentPic = this.pictures[this.currentPicture];

        html = '&lt;div id=pictureFrame&gt;';
        html += '&lt;img src=' + currentPic.src + ' alt="' + currentPic.caption + '"&gt;';
        if (currentPic.caption !== undefined) {
            html += '&lt;div id=pictureCaption&gt;' + currentPic.caption + '&lt;/div&gt;';
        }
        html += '&lt;/div&gt;';

        this.container.innerHTML = html;
    };</pre>
</code>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="span4">
<p>
8. Now we will enable the SlideShow component to accept a list of pictures to display. To do this we'll add two methods (code to far right) called addPicture( ) and addPictures( ).In both functions, we update this.pictures array with one or an array of members, based on the argument sent to it.</p>
<p>Next we'll edit the HTML document on which we want the slideshow to render. We add this script tag to the bottom of the body element.</p>
<p>First we create a new instance of our SlideShow( ) object, calling it's constructor by using the new keyword.  The argument is the ID of the container element we created in step 1.</p>
<p> Next we define the specific data for the object and set of objects by passing object literals containing the src and caption properties to these two methods we created in the prototype of SlideShow.</p>
</div>
<div class="span4"><code>
  <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;script&gt; 
  'use strict';           
var mySlideShow = new SlideShow('slideshow');            
mySlideShow.addPicture({
                src: 'images/brendan-eich.jpg',
                caption: 'Brendan Eich &mdash; The Creator of JavaScript'
            });

            mySlideShow.addPictures([{
                src: 'images/john-resig.jpg',
                caption: 'John Resig &mdash; The Creator of jQuery'
            }, {
                src: 'images/douglas-crockford.jpg',
                caption: 'Douglas Crockford &mdash; The JavaScript Guy'
            }, {
                src: 'images/larry-ellison.jpg',
                caption: 'Larry Ellison &mdash; The Owner of JavaScript'
            }]);
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</code>
</div>
<div class="span4">
<code>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    SlideShow.prototype.addPictures = function (pics) {
        this.pictures = this.pictures.concat(pics);
    };
    SlideShow.prototype.addPicture = function (pic) {
        this.pictures.push(pic);
    };

    </pre>
</code>
</div>
</div>


<div class="row">

9. In this step we create the methods which operate the slideshow, using a timer to move from picture to picture. Each function is declared as a prototype property of SlideShow and uses this.x notation as an internal self-reference to itself - the current instance of the SlideShow object referred to from within a method of its prototype.</p>
<p>In the play method we invoke the window.setInterval timer to cycle our slideshow. In Javascript when you define one function inside another THIS automatically gets set to the global scope. This can be confusing because you expect THIS to have the same value as it does in the outer function.</p>
<p>So you use a common convention to get around the problem, assigning the reference to our SlideShow to a variable named THAT, which can then be accessed within the scope of the anonymous function passed to window.setInterval( ).</p>
<p>The use of the name THAT is a common convention to aid developers to understand the variable's purpose.</p>
<p>The remaining functions should be somewhat straightforward.  We use the timer property to reflect whether our slideshow is on pause or play and we invoke our render( )method from within the cycle( ) method, which advances the counter (this.currentPicture) through the length of the object literal that we declared on the webpage.  </p>
<p>Our slideshow is complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="span8">
<code>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
SlideShow.prototype.play = function () {
        var that = this;
        this.render();
        this.timer = window.setInterval(function () {
            that.cycle();
        }, 5000);
    };
    
    SlideShow.prototype.pause = function () {
        window.clearInterval(this.timer);
        this.timer = null;
    };
    
    SlideShow.prototype.isPlaying = function () {
        return this.timer !== null;
    };

    SlideShow.prototype.cycle = function () {
        if (this.currentPicture + 1 === this.pictures.length) {
            this.currentPicture = 0;
        } else {
            this.currentPicture += 1;
        }

        this.render();
    };</pre>
</code>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="span4">
<p>
10. The final step in using our slideshow module is to have the webpage invoke the play method of it's slideshow.  We can add this invocation statement to the script we created in step 8 and our slideshow should start to play when the page is loaded.</p>
</div>
<div class="span8">
<code>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
........
  mySlideShow.play();
  &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</code>
</div>
</div>


 <h2>Assignment Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Add  controls (play/pause button)</li>
            <li>Add  parameters or pass an object to the SlideShow 
                constructor, to allow the user to configure the slide
                change delay.</li>
            <li>EXTRA CREDIT: Add some more advanced controls: forward/backward 
                buttons, clickable thumbnails, etc.</li>
            <li>EXTRA CREDIT: Implement some form of pre-caching for the images.</li>
        </ul>
