        <h1>Syllabus for CS 55.11 Javascript &amp; JQuery Fall 2012 </h1>
        <p>Welcome to Javascript! This class will open your mind about web design and programming - whether you are an experienced programmer or not. </p>
        <p>This class is a <em>blended class</em>. While you enrolled in either  online section 1371 or  in-class section 1516 on Tuesday evenings, the class is essentially an online class, the Tuesday evening lecture/labs are optional - no attendance taken. The classes are   broadcast live and archived for later viewing. While attendance is not required in the classroom regardless of which section you enrolled in, the material in the lectures is generally required material for the class. </p>
        <p>This syllabus page is the primary hub for information about the class throughout the semester, so bookmark it now. </p>
        <p>Check in to the CATE system now to access exams, gradebooks and the class forum. </p>

        <h3>Course Information</h3>
          <h4>Required Materials</h4>
           <p>There is NO REQUIRED SOFTWARE, although you will need a good code editor and a webserver account (an SRJC student account is fine, but you may also use your own domain or another host.) You will also need to use a current version of an HTML5 browser with a great element inspector (Chrome, FireFox, Opera or Internet Explorer 9+ will work.)</p>

<p>You may use the Computer Studies labs in Santa Rosa and Petaluma during regularly scheduled lab hours, or you may also work at your own computer. You MUST be self-sufficient with basic webserver fundamentals and be able to use FTP to deploy a website.</p>
           <p>This class has no REQUIRED textbooks, but  the curriculum is loosely based on these two books . There are many fantastic Javascript books, I highly recomment that you  have at least one or two available as you take this class.</p>

           <h4>Grading Policy </h4>
 <p>Your final grade will be based on the following:</p>

</table>
<ul><li>91% -100% = A</li>
<li>81% -9 0% = B</li>
<li>71% - 80% = C</li>
<li>65% - 70% = D</li>
<li>&lt;65 = F</li></ul>

  <h4>Tests and Quizzes</h4>
  <p>There will be five online quizzes throughout the course and an online midterm and final
    exam. The material comes from the class lectures and supplemental materials. If any exam is missed, a zero will be recorded as the score. It is your responsibility
    to take the online exams by the due date.</p>
  <h4>Projects</h4>
  <p>You must submit six complete projects throughout the semester.</p>
  <p>There are twelve project tutorials assigned throughout the semester and your projects
    could be based on these examples or on others as pre-approved by the instructor.
    You are required to maintain a website to publish and document your projects. Your site can be hosted at your own
    private domain or at Santa Rosa Junior College, which offers students free web hosting
    services.</p>
  <h4>Late Projects</h4>
  <p>Projects are late if not submitted by Sunday at midnight following the class that the
    assignment is due.  Late assignments can be submitted (or resubmitted with instructors consent) for 75%
    credit up to one week after the due date. Any assignments turned in more than one week
    late will receive no credit.</p>
  <h4>Credit-No Credit</h4>
  <p>You may take this class credit/no-credit. You must decide before the fifth class and file the
    appropriate form with Admissions and Records. You must complete the midterm and final
    quizzes and projects to receive class credit.</p>
  <h4>Dropping the Class</h4>
  <p>If you decide to discontinue this course, it is your responsibility to officially drop it to avoid
    getting no refund (after 10% of course length), a W symbol (after 20%), or a grade (after
    60%). Also, for several consecutive, unexplained absences, the instructor may drop a
    student.</p>

          <h2>Class Outline</h2>
          <p>This class is designed to build a solid set of skills using a variety of current techniques and resources. We start by exploring the fundamentals of programming using the Javascript language.
