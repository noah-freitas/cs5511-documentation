          <h2>Course Information</h2>
            <h4>Official Course Catalog Description</h4>
          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-based scripting language. This course provides a solid foundation in JavaScript and shows students how to create scripts and incorporate them into webpages.  Projects include writing Javascript and JQuery programs that manage dynamic content and webpage elements such as image slideshows; menus, tabs and panels; form controls and dialogues.   Students will also create data-driven web elements using AJAX and API interfaces to web services such as maps and social media.</p>
          <h4>Student Learning Objectives</h4>
          <p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:<br>
          </strong></p>
          <div>Students will be able to:</div>
          <div>1.  Analyze and customize existing JavaScript code.</div>
          <div>2.  Code and deploy basic to intermediate JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX programs.</div>
          <div>3.  Demonstrate and apply the Document Object Model (DOM) and other fundamental Internet technologies accessible through Javascript.</div>
          <div> </div>
          <strong><br>
          Objectives:
          </strong>
          <div>Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:</div>
          <div>1. Analyze and customize Javascript code.</div>
          <div>2. Write JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX code that selects and manages document elements, validates form data, creates interactive elements, accesses server data.</div>
          <div>3. Apply appropriate user experience and interactive design concepts to custom websites.</div>
          <div>4. Demonstrate JavaScript scripting skills in a variety of student-designed projects.</div>
<h4>Required Materials</h4>
           <p>There is NO REQUIRED SOFTWARE, although you will need a good code editor and a webserver account (an SRJC student account is fine, but you may also use your own domain or another host.) You will also need to use a current version of an HTML5 browser with a great element inspector (Chrome, FireFox, Opera or Internet Explorer 9+ will work.)</p>

<p>You may use the Computer Studies labs in Santa Rosa and Petaluma during regularly scheduled lab hours, or you may also work at your own computer. You MUST be self-sufficient with basic webserver fundamentals and be able to use FTP to deploy a website.</p>
           <p>This class has no REQUIRED textbooks, but  the curriculum is loosely based on these two books . There are many fantastic Javascript books, I highly recomment that you  have at least one or two available as you take this class.</p>

<ul><li>91% -100% = A</li>
<li>81% -9 0% = B</li>
<li>71% - 80% = C</li>
<li>65% - 70% = D</li>
<li>&lt;65 = F</li></ul>

  <h4>Tests and Quizzes</h4>
  <p>There will be five online quizzes throughout the course and an online midterm and final
    exam. The material comes from the class lectures and supplemental materials. If any exam is missed, a zero will be recorded as the score. It is your responsibility
    to take the online exams by the due date.</p>
  <h4>Projects</h4>
  <p>You must submit at least six complete projects throughout the semester.</p>
  <p>There are eight project tutorials assigned throughout the semester and your projects
    could be based on these examples or on others as pre-approved by the instructor.
    You are required to maintain a website to publish and document your projects. Your site can be hosted at your own
    private domain or at Santa Rosa Junior College, which offers students free web hosting
    services.</p>
  <h4>Late Projects</h4>
  <p>Projects are late if not submitted by Sunday at midnight following the class that the
    assignment is due.  Late assignments can be submitted (or resubmitted with instructors consent) for 75%
    credit up to one week after the due date. Any assignments turned in more than one week
    late will receive no credit.</p>
  <h4>Credit-No Credit</h4>
  <p>You may take this class credit/no-credit. You must decide before the fifth class and file the
    appropriate form with Admissions and Records. You must complete the midterm and final
    quizzes and projects to receive class credit.</p>
  <h4>Dropping the Class</h4>
  <p>If you decide to discontinue this course, it is your responsibility to officially drop it to avoid
    getting no refund (after 10% of course length), a W symbol (after 20%), or a grade (after
    60%). Also, for several consecutive, unexplained absences, the instructor may drop a
    student.</p>

          <h2>Class Outline</h2>
          <p>This class is designed to build a solid set of skills using a variety of current techniques and resources. We start by exploring the fundamentals of programming using the Javascript language. We will relearn some techniques when we introduce the JQuery library and its more intuitive syntax.</p>
