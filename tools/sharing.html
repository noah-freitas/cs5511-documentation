                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>As you learn JavaScript, you will no doubt run into situations
                        where your code just doesn't work and you can't figure out
                        why.  In these situations, having someone else look at
                        your code can be very helpful.</p>
                    <p>The most primitive way of having someone review your code
                        is giving it to them as plain text, either through an email,
                        forum post, or the URL to your website.  While this method 
                        works in some situations it assumes that the reviewer will 
                        be able to see the problem without working with your code 
                        in a live environment.</p>
                    <p>If the reviewer needs a chance to modify and execute your
                        code, this approach normally fails because it can be very
                        difficult for the reviewer to recreate your full environment,
                        and most casual reviewers will not take the time required
                        for this.</p>
                    <h3>Introducing JsFiddle</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        JsFiddle is a playground for web developers, a tool which 
                        may be used in many ways. One can use it as an online 
                        editor for snippets build from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
                        The code can then be shared with others, embedded on a 
                        blog, etc. Using this approach, JavaScript developers can 
                        very easily isolate bugs.

                    <p><a href=http://jsfiddle.net/ target=_blank>JsFiddle</a>
                        is relatively new and still officially in alpha.
                        In spite of this, it has become the <em>de facto</em>
                        standard for sharing JavaScript code and snippets for
                        review on forum sites like <a href=http://stackoverflow.com/ 
                        target=_blank>Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
                    <p>The reasons for its popularity quickly become obvious as
                        you begin to use it.  You can easily mockup a situation
                        (in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that is giving you 
                        trouble and send or post the link for review.  Other developers
                        can then adjust your code in a live/executable
                        environment and send it back to you once they've worked
                        out the bugs.  There is no extra effort to recreate your
                        environment as you are basically handing them an editable
                        version of it.</p>

                        <h3>Using the Different Panes</h3>
                        <p>Generally you will place your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                            into the different panes like you were creating a 
                            webpage, with a few exceptions:</p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>HTML Pane</dt>
                            <dd>Only place the HTML markup that would go inside
                                your &lt;body> tag.  Don't include any of the
                                structure above it (&lt;html> or &lt;head> tags)
                                </dd>
                            <dt>CSS Pane</dt>
                            <dd>Only place your CSS rules.  You can treat this
                                pane as if it were an external CSS file.</dd>
                            <dt>JavaScript Pane</dt>
                            <dd>Only place your JavaScript code.  You can also
                                treat this as if it contained the contents of an
                                external JS file.</dd>
                        </dl>
                        <h3>Other Configuration Options</h3>
                        <p>As we start the class you will probably want to configure
                            your fiddles in the following way:</p>
